        <p>The <strong>Pirin Mountains</strong> (Bulgarian: Пирин) are a mountain range in southwestern Bulgaria, with <strong>Vihren</strong> at an altitude of 2,914 m being the highest peak.</p>
        <p>The mountain is named after Perun (Bulgarian: Перун), the highest god of the Slavic pantheon and the god of thunder and lightning. In the Antiquity the range was called <em>Perinthos</em> by the Thracians, meaning "Rocky Mountain".</p>
